Show user metadata in a metabox when editing users - a great tool for debugging issues with user metadata.

== Description ==

**The JSM's Show User Metadata plugin displays user profile meta keys and their unserialized values in a metabox at the bottom of user profile editing pages.**

The current user must have the [WordPress *manage_options* capability](https://wordpress.org/support/article/roles-and-capabilities/#manage_options) (allows access to administration options) to view the User Metadata metabox, and the *manage_options* capability to delete individual meta keys.

The default *manage_options* capability can be modified using the 'jsmsum_show_metabox_capability' and 'jsmsum_delete_meta_capability' filters (see filters.txt in the plugin folder).

There are no plugin settings - simply install and activate the plugin.
