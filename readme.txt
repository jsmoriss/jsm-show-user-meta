Show all user meta (aka custom fields) in a metabox on user editing pages -- a great tool for debugging issues with user meta.

== Description ==

**Wondering about the user meta your theme and/or plugins might be creating?**

**Want to find the name of a specific user meta key?**

**Need some help debugging your user meta (aka custom fields)?**

The JSM's Show User Metadata plugin displays all user meta keys and their unserialized values in a metabox at the bottom of user profile editing pages.

There are no plugin settings &mdash; simply *install* and *activate* the plugin.
